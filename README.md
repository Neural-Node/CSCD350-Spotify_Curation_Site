# CSCD350-Spotify_Curation_Site
This repository is for the Group Project for Team 6 for EWU Spring CSCD350

Description:

This is a digital music service that gives the opportunity for millions to 
control and listen to music all over the world. Everyone loves music, however 
finding and managing specific types of music is not easy. This user-friendly application will 
give you a new experience with music. The project is going to be done by a team. In the team, everyone 
has their own knowledge other than common knowledge about software engineering. Every member will work on the 
part that they are most confident in the project. Team work will combine and be checked by the group leader at 
the end of every week, and the leader is going to check the team every day to make sure everyone is on the same 
page. Therefore, it is going to be ready to use in a reasonable time.
